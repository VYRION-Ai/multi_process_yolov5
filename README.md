# multi_process_yolov5
use Yolov5 Hub to do multi process  object detection , and get more speed 

How to use:

1-extract yolov5.rar( or you can clone yolov5 repo).

2- run main.py

*  you want to change the image size , source, weights as you need 
- it works well with video, but with live camera it will need high power gpu (because it will make detection for all captured frames , no frame will be losed) 
- it faster that normle hub and normal detect.py
